    <h3>This Lasagna Recipe is easy to make with a creamy cheese mixture, savory meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese.
        BONUS: it’s make-ahead and freezer-friendly!</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Store-bought red pasta sauce</li>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>An egg</li>
        <li>Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles until just al dente. Don’t overcook or they’ll become mushy in the oven.</li>
        <li> Brown the ground beef, add the pasta sauce and cook until sauce is hot and beef is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Mix ricotta with egg, salt, and pepper and set aside</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna. You’ll be doing three layers of noodles with sauce and cheese in between, alternating between laying the noodles horizontally and vertically. 
            (This helps hold the layers together after baking.)</li>
        <li>Bake and allow the lasagna to rest for 10 minutes before serving otherwise it will be so gooey the slices won’t hold together. Serve and enjoy!</li>
